# 🏏 IPL Best XI Selection using Data Science

## 📌 Project Overview
This project selects the **Best Playing XI** from IPL data using data-driven performance analysis.  
Players are chosen based on batting and bowling statistics instead of manual judgement.

The goal is to demonstrate how cricket analytics can support objective team selection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze batsmen performance using runs and strike rate.
- Analyze bowlers using economy rate.
- Select a balanced Best XI team using data.
- Visualize top performing players.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Batting Analysis
- Total runs scored by each batsman
- Balls faced
- Strike Rate calculation

### 2️⃣ Bowling Analysis
- Runs conceded by each bowler
- Balls bowled
- Economy Rate calculation

### 3️⃣ Team Selection Logic
- Top 6 batsmen (runs + strike rate)
- Top 5 bowlers (lowest economy)

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Top batsmen bar chart
- Data-driven Best XI table

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Players with consistent scoring and high strike rates were selected as batsmen.
- Bowlers with lower economy rates were prioritized.
- The project shows how analytics can help in cricket decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Include wickets and batting average
- Role-based selection (Openers, All-rounders, Finishers)
- Advanced machine learning selection model
